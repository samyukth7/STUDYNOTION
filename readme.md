## Frontend Development Details

To build the front end, I utilized frameworks and libraries such as ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. I also employed CSS and Tailwind, which are styling frameworks that enhance the appearance and responsiveness of the user interface. Additionally, I integrated npm packages to add extra functionality to the front end. For managing the application's state, I utilized Redux, a well-known state management library for React. Finally, I utilized VSCode, a popular code editor, as the development environment for building the front end.
